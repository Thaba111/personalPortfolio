            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- details about myself -->
            <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Edith Thaba, a passionate learner and enthusiastic web developer. <br>As I work toward a certification in Software Engineering at Moringa School, I've had the chance to hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills through a variety of projects and classes. <br> My area of expertise is developing engaging and dynamic websites. Using the Art Gallery Project, one of my most recent projects, my dedication to pushing and applying what I have learnt is clearly evident.  </p>

        <section id="achievements">
            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>In the realm of achievements, I embody a commitment to hard work, clear goals, and a fearless approach to challenges. Graduating in finance marked the beginning of my journey, but it's the pursuit of knowledge that defines my character. <br> Completing the intensive Financial Management and Valuation Analysis (FMVA) certification through ALX showcased not just my hardworking ethos but a goal-oriented mindset committed to excellence.
                Beyond finance, venturing into IT without prior knowledge speaks to my tenacity in facing challenges head-on. This narrative is about more than accomplishments; it's a testament to the resilience that propels me to triumph over obstacles, revealing a versatile, hardworking, and goal-oriented individual prepared to conquer any challenge.

            <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            <p>As a self-confessed adrenaline junkie, I've developed a strong passsion for go-karting because the thrilling mix of strategy and speed produces a thrilling balance between intensity and pure enjoyment. Away from the track,<br> my interests become more peaceful. Even though I enjoy watching movies, being in the peace and quiet of nature is when I truly feel happy.<br> My relationship with nature, whether it be through a hike along a nature trail or a leisurely stroll through a park, gives me a deep sense of fulfillment and calmness.

        <section id="Curreent Reads">
            <h2>Current Reads</h2>
               <p>Engaging with insightful literature, particularly "No Degree, No Problem" by Josh Kemp, and "Software <br> Engineering at Google," has instilled profound lessons. These books emphasize the transformative power of mindset, <br> especially when navigating challenges such as entering the IT field without prior knowledge. They emphasize <br> on adaptability, continuous learning, and resilience as essential traits. These teachings serve <br> as pillars in my tech journey, shaping my approach to coding and problem-solving. The books reinforce <br> the belief that a determined mindset and a passion for learning can overcome any perceived <br>disadvantage, turning challenges into opportunities for growth in the dynamic world of IT.</p>
